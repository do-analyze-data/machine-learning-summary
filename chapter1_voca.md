### What is Machine Learning?

1. `Machine learning`: Using computers to learn undefined patterns using data
2. `Deep learning`: Based on artificial neural network theory, learning method that utilizes input/output layers and multiple hidden layers similar to human neurons
3. Three perspective of machine learning
  * `Insight` : The belief that data has some pattern.
  * `Suitability of data` (fit)
  * `Theoretical strictness` (analysis): Analysis of machine learning algorithm theory.
4. Three classifications of machine learning based on goals to solve
  * `supervised learning`:  Machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data
      * `Classification`: Classify data with multiple attributes into one of the predefined data
      * `Regression`: Predict consecutive values through inferred functions
  * `unupservised learning`: Learn the computer without giving the correct answer to the data
      * ``

  * `Reinforcement  learning`: The agent takes some action on the given environment and proceeds to get some reward from it
